matlab files
============
A collection of m-files. Most of them are strongly related to the Sphere Decoding Algorithms by A. Ghasemmehdi and E. Agrell, 2011.

You can use all files I am the author of. The only condition is attributing them to me (Marco Falke). Other files (another author is specified) may be restricted in usage.
